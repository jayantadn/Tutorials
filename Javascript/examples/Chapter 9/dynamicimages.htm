         <h3>The Earth</h3>
         Earth (or the Earth) is the third planet from the Sun, and the
         densest and fifth-largest of the eight planets in the Solar
         System.<br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also the largest of the
         Solar System's four terrestrial planets. It is sometimes
         referred to as the World, the Blue Planet, or by its Latin
         name, Terra.<br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Home to millions of species
         including humans, Earth is currently the only place where life
         is known to exist. The planet formed 4.54 billion years ago,
         and life appeared on its surface within a billion years.<br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earth's biosphere has
         significantly altered the atmosphere and other abiotic
         conditions on the planet, enabling the proliferation of aerobic
         organisms as well as the formation of the ozone layer which,
         together with Earth's magnetic field, blocks harmful solar
         radiation, permitting life on land.<br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The physical properties of the
         Earth, as well as its geological history and orbit, have allowed
         life to persist during this period. The planet is expected to
         continue supporting life for at least another 500 million years.
